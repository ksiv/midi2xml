### midi2xml
midi2xml - A parser of midi file written on PHP. This is a piece of an old project of mine (10 years or more) cought in the early development stage. If you have an old version of PHP for some reason , cut away namespaces and it will work. Maybe I have enough time one day for a hobby  and will be back to my initial project. 

### purpose
It has no code quality to be called a software and has no value in this aspect but might be of interest for someone who is up to code a midi parser or the first binary parser on PHP.
